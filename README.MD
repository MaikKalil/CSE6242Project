<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

The roadmap is intended to highlight opportunities for future development

- [x] Build local web app
- [ ] Add additional inputs for test scores to allow user to specify how these scores are normalized in RankHandler. \
      (e.g. Currently the 25th percentile is used but perhaps the user would prefer the 75th percentile to see schools with higher test scores.)   
- [ ] Add additional preferences for sports and/or college rankings. \
      (NCAA and U.S. News World College rankings would require permission.)
- [ ] Deploy web app to cloud service such MS Azure to expand access to a wider audience. \
      (Production deployment will require modification of code to handle concurrent users.)

See the [open issues](https://github.com/MaikKalil/CSE6242Project/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
